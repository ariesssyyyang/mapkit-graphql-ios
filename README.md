# MapKitPractice

## Purpose

Practice for `MapKit`.

And use `Yelp` server to request restaurants' locations.

Instead of using normal HTTP `GET` request with query parameters,

I choose to use GraphQL which use `POST` method, and

wrap query parameters and what is wanted for response body into request body.
